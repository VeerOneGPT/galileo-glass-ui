## Key Patterns for Test Fixes

### Self-Contained Test Environment
- Create fresh mock environments for each test
- Prevent state leakage between tests
- Include proper cleanup in try/finally blocks
- Use setupTest/cleanupTest pattern to ensure proper test isolation

### Mocking Strategy
- Mock DOM APIs that are not available in jsdom
- Provide consistent performance.now() mocks
- Create simplified versions of complex dependencies
- Use consistent timers for animations

### Physics Testing Approach
- Implement clear request animation frame mocks
- Isolate physics calculations from timing dependencies
- Use predictable inputs for deterministic outputs
- Apply proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks

### Hook Testing Best Practices
- Wrap tests with all required providers
- Mock refs with appropriate element structures
- Use act() for state updates and event simulations
- Properly wait for async effects to complete

### Animation Testing
- Create controlled time advancement with mockTime
- Use manual time setting for precise animation progress checks
- Isolate animation frame callbacks from real timing
- Implement simplified interpolation for predictable results

### Event System Testing
- Create simplified mock implementations of event systems
- Focus on core functionality rather than complete API coverage
- Ensure proper subscription/unsubscription behavior
- Verify event propagation and handling

### Spring Physics Testing
- Mock the spring physics system with simplified implementation
- Implement key methods (setTarget, reset, update, isAtRest)
- Control timing progression with fake timers
- Use helper functions to advance animation frames

### Floating Point Testing
- Use toBeCloseTo instead of toBe for floating point comparisons
- Test general behavior patterns instead of exact values for complex animations
- Avoid brittle tests with exact numeric assertions for oscillating functions
- Check for characteristic behaviors (e.g., oscillation, overshooting) rather than specific values

### CSS Generation Testing
- Test overall structure rather than exact string matches
- Use regular expressions to test for important CSS properties
- Focus on key characteristic styles for each animation type
- Check relationships between inputs and outputs rather than exact values
- Allow for reasonable tolerance in numeric values due to randomization

### Particle System Testing
- Mock DOM elements with proper hierarchical structure
- Implement controlled animation frame advancement
- Track and manually trigger animation callbacks
- Test particle creation, update and removal lifecycle
- Verify performance optimizations work as expected
- Ensure proper resource cleanup and disposal

### Vector Field Testing
- Test both basic and complex field configurations
- Verify force direction and magnitude independently
- Use appropriate tolerances for angle calculations
- Test field behavior across different quadrants/regions
- Verify modifiers work in isolation and combination
- Test edge cases like zero vectors and extreme values
