# Galileo Glass UI v1.0.3

## Overview
This release introduces a comprehensive physics-based animation system and 10 new Glass components, along with significant accessibility and performance improvements.

## Key Features

### Enhanced Animation System
- Custom Physics Engine with spring physics, inertial movement, and momentum-based interactions
- Collision detection and response system
- Unified physics API with extensive interpolation functions
- Web Animations API (WAAPI) renderer with requestAnimationFrame fallback
- Performance optimizations with DOM operation batching and transform consolidation
- GPU acceleration for smooth animations
- Device capability detection for adaptive performance
- Enhanced accessibility features for motion sensitivity and reduced motion
- Animation composition with timing-agnostic synchronization
- Gesture-driven animation system for natural interactions

### New Glass Components
- GlassTooltip: Physics-based glass tooltip with intelligent positioning
- GlassDataChart: Chart components with glass styling and physics interactions
- GlassTabBar: Advanced tab navigation with physics-based selection indicator
