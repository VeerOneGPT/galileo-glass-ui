# Game Animation Framework (Conceptual)

**Note:** The features described here were outlined in the `animate2.md` enhancement plan but may be highly specialized, intended for internal use, or might not have been fully implemented for general developer consumption. Verify existence and API details in the codebase or specific examples if needed.

Galileo Glass UI's animation plan included concepts for a framework inspired by game development techniques, aimed at creating engaging, state-driven interactive experiences.

## Core Concepts (from Plan)

- **State Transitions:** Managing animations based on application or game state changes (`useGameAnimation`).
- **Specialized Physics:** Physics behaviors optimized for game-like interactions (`useGamePhysics`).
- **Trajectories & Projectiles:** Calculating realistic paths for elements moving under forces like gravity.
- **Particle Effects:** Generating dynamic particle bursts for emphasis or feedback (Covered in [Particle System](./particle-system.md)).
- **Sprite Animations:** Supporting traditional frame-by-frame animations.
- **Scene/Level Transitions:** Creating smooth transitions between major UI states or views.

## Potential Hooks (Conceptual)

### `useGameAnimation`

- **Purpose:** Manage animations tied to discrete application states (e.g., loading, playing, game over, success screen).
- **Functionality:** Could trigger specific entrance/exit animations or continuous state-based animations (like character idle loops) when the application state changes.

### `useGamePhysics`

- **Purpose:** Provide physics simulations tailored for interactive game elements, potentially differing from standard UI physics (e.g., different gravity, collision handling optimized for many small objects).
- **Functionality:** Might offer specialized forces, collision detection, or character controllers.

## Trajectory Calculation

- The plan mentioned support for calculating projectile motion. This could involve utility functions to predict the path of an element given initial velocity, gravity, and air resistance, useful for aiming interfaces or predictive animations.

## Sprite Animation System

- **Purpose:** Enable frame-based animations using sprite sheets.
- **Functionality:** Likely involves a component or hook that takes a sprite sheet image, dimensions, frame rate, and animation sequence definitions (e.g., 'walk', 'jump', 'idle') and handles rendering the correct frame over time.

## Scene Transitions

- **Purpose:** Create animated transitions between different major sections or views of an application, akin to level transitions in games.
- **Functionality:** Might involve coordinating exit animations for the old scene and entrance animations for the new scene, possibly using techniques like screen wipes, fades, or more complex 3D transitions.

## Applicability

While designed with game-like interactions in mind, these concepts could potentially be used in standard applications for:

- Complex onboarding sequences.
- Highly interactive data visualizations.
- Gamified elements or tutorials.
- Elaborate state transition animations.

**Recommendation:** Due to the specialized nature, check for explicit examples or specific component implementations (`GlassTimeline`, `GlassCarousel`, etc., might use parts of this internally) before attempting to use these conceptual hooks directly. They might not be exposed as part of the general public API.
