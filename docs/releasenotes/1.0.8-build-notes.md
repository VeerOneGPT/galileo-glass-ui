# Galileo Glass UI v1.0.8 - Build Notes

This document summarizes the features and enhancements delivered as part of the Galileo Glass UI v1.0.8 update, focusing on exposing the core physics engine.

## Phase 1: Physics Engine API Exposure Delivered

The core goal of this release was to provide developers with lower-level access to the underlying physics and collision systems.

### Physics Engine Hook (`useGalileoPhysicsEngine`)
*   Implemented `src/animations/physics/useGalileoPhysicsEngine.ts` hook to initialize and manage dedicated instances of the internal `GalileoPhysicsSystem` and `CollisionSystem`.
*   Exposed a stable `GalileoPhysicsEngineAPI` object for interacting with the engine instance.
*   Defined clear public types (`PhysicsBodyOptions`, `PhysicsBodyState`, `CollisionEvent`, etc.) in `src/animations/physics/engineTypes.ts`.
*   Hook accepts optional `PhysicsConfig` to customize engine behavior (gravity, timestep, etc.).

### Body Management API
*   Implemented `addBody` function to add physics bodies (with specified shape, position, mass, material properties) to both physics and collision systems.
*   Implemented `removeBody` function to remove bodies from both systems.
*   Implemented `getBodyState` and `getAllBodyStates` for retrieving current physics state (position, velocity, angle) suitable for rendering synchronization.
*   Implemented `updateBodyState` for direct state manipulation (advised against for simulated motion).
*   Added `userData` property support to physics and collision bodies for attaching custom data.

### Force and Impulse API
*   Implemented `applyForce` and `applyImpulse` methods to apply forces/impulses to the center of mass of specified bodies.
*   (Note: Point application for torque is identified as not currently supported by the internal system).

### Collision Event API
*   Implemented `onCollisionStart`, `onCollisionActive`, and `onCollisionEnd` methods for subscribing to collision events detected by the internal `CollisionSystem`.
*   Collision event callbacks receive detailed `CollisionEvent` data (involved bodies, contact info, user data).
*   Ensured collision detection is synchronized with the physics simulation loop using the physics system's internal `step` event.

## Phase 2: Documentation & Integration Delivered

Supporting documentation and examples were created for the new API.

### Documentation
*   Created API documentation `docs/physics/engine-api.md` detailing the hook, types, methods, and usage notes.
*   Created an example implementation `docs/examples/animations/CustomPhysicsDemo.tsx` demonstrating hook usage, body creation, state synchronization for rendering, and collision event handling.
*   Updated core project documentation (`README.md`, etc.) to include information and links regarding the new physics engine API.
*   Finalized `CHANGELOG-1.0.8.md` reflecting delivered features and known pending items.

### Refinements & Fixes
*   Addressed type errors and import issues related to physics and collision system integration within the hook.
*   Refactored the integration between physics and collision systems for improved robustness (using events instead of method patching).
*   Verified and corrected type exports (`Vector2D`, `UnsubscribeFunction`, `CollisionShape`).

## Phase 3: Testing and Performance (Pending)

*   **Testing:** Unit, integration, and comprehensive scenario testing remain as pending tasks for this feature.
*   **Performance:** Performance profiling under various load conditions is marked as pending.
