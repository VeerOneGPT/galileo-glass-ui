## Build Process Summary

The v1.0.22 build focuses on resolving critical bugs and enhancing existing features in the Galileo Glass UI library. This release addresses several rendering and functionality issues in key components such as `GlassDataGrid`, `DataChart`, and `Card`. It also fixes problems in the physics and animation systems, particularly with the `usePhysicsInteraction` hook's magnetic type and the `useAnimationSequence` hook's initialization. Additionally, the release introduces significant enhancements to the `useGameAnimation` hook, integrating it more deeply with the library's physics, glass, and dimensional effect systems.

### 1. Bug Fixes

1. **`useParticleSystem` Hook Export (Bug #16):**
   * Fixed the export of the `useParticleSystem` hook implemented in v1.0.21.
   * Verified the hook is properly exported from both the main entry point (`@veerone/galileo-glass-ui`) and the hooks subpath (`@veerone/galileo-glass-ui/hooks`).
   * Confirmed all related types (`ParticleSystemOptions`, `ParticleSystemResult`, etc.) are correctly exported.

2. **`GlassDataGrid` Visual Rendering (Bug #17):**
   * Fixed issue where `GlassDataGrid` failed to render its table structure and data correctly.
   * Verified the component properly uses `DimensionalGlass` as its root element.
   * Confirmed props like `variant` and `elevation` are correctly passed to `DimensionalGlass`.

3. **Persistent DataChart Errors (Bug #18):**
   * Resolved TypeError issues when switching chart variants with legends enabled.
   * Fixed "Maximum update depth exceeded" errors occurring with interaction options like `zoomPanEnabled` and `physicsHoverEffects` set to `false`.
   * Improved hover logic to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

4. **`Card` Component Invalid Attribute (Bug #17 - Parallax part):**
   * Fixed React DOM error: `Error: Received \`true\` for a non-boolean attribute \`parallax\``.
   * Confirmed the `Card` component does not pass hardcoded `parallax={true}` to `DimensionalGlass`.

5. **`usePhysicsInteraction` Magnetic Type (Bug #19):**
   * Fixed non-functional magnetic interaction type that was not correctly applying attraction and repulsion forces.
   * Improved force vector calculations based on `strength` and `radius`.
   * Ensured correct application of forces to the physics simulation.

6. **`useAnimationSequence` Initialization (Bug #20):**
   * Fixed issues with applying initial `from` state to target elements.
   * Improved sequence execution according to defined durations, delays, and easing.
   * Enhanced reliability of control functions (`play`, `pause`, `stop`, `reset`, `seek`).
   * Added warnings for placeholder implementations.

### 2. Feature Enhancements

1. **Enhanced `useGameAnimation` Hook:**
   * Integrated physics-based transitions using existing spring hooks (`useGalileoStateSpring`, `useMultiSpring`).
   * Added support for animating glass effect properties (blur, opacity) using `useGlassEffects` mixins.
   * Implemented 3D transition types leveraging `useZSpace` and `use3DTransform`.
   * Added advanced orchestration options within transition definitions.
   * Integrated `MotionSensitivityLevel` for nuanced accessibility adaptations.
   * Added debugging options for easier development.
   * Implemented component state synchronization with game animation states.
   * Integrated with `useGesturePhysics` to allow user interaction during transitions.

### 3. Documentation Updates

1. **Updated Documentation:**
   * Updated `README.md` "What's New" section to reflect v1.0.22 changes.
   * Updated JSDoc comments in `Button.tsx` for `physicsOptions`.
   * Created `GameAnimation.stories.tsx` to demonstrate enhanced `useGameAnimation` hook.
   * Created `docs/changelog/CHANGELOG-1.0.22.md` detailing all changes.
   * Updated version numbers in `package.json` and `src/index.ts`.
