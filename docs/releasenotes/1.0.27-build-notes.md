## Build Process Summary

The v1.0.27 build culminates a series of critical fixes primarily targeting stability issues within the physics engine and related hooks, which caused "Maximum update depth exceeded" errors (Bugs #22, #25, #27). It also addresses hook export problems (Bug #24) and restores broken functionality (Bug #23). This release introduces significant new features, including a scroll reveal hook/component and a consolidated adaptive quality hook. The focus was on stabilizing core interactions, ensuring proper exports, fixing regressions, and adding requested enhancements, alongside comprehensive documentation updates.

### 1. Bug Fixes

1.  **Physics Engine Stability (Maximum Update Depth - Bug #22, #25):**
    *   **v1.0.25 Fix:** Prevented infinite loops from synchronous state updates in physics event callbacks (e.g., collisions) by making event dispatch asynchronous.
    *   **v1.0.26 Fix:** Resolved infinite loops originating *within* library components (`GlassStepper`, physics-enabled `DataChart`) by correcting internal state management and effect dependencies in related hooks (`useVectorSpring`, `useChartPhysicsInteraction`, `usePhysicsInteraction`).
    *   **v1.0.27 Fix:** Addressed high-frequency update loops (`setTimeout(0)` issue) in `useGalileoPhysicsEngine` by replacing with `requestAnimationFrame` and implementing better update throttling.

2.  **Core Hook Exports & Usage (Bug #24):**
    *   Fixed build configuration and export paths in `src/hooks/index.ts` and `src/index.ts` to ensure `useGesturePhysics` and `useGalileoPhysicsEngine` are reliably exported and importable from the main package entry point.
    *   Updated documentation (`docs/hooks/import-paths.md`) with correct import paths and TypeScript workarounds.

3.  **DataChart Physics Zoom/Pan Functionality (Bug #23):**
    *   Restored non-functional physics-based zoom (scroll) and pan (drag) which broke after v1.0.25 fixes.
    *   Investigated and corrected the activation logic within `DataChart` and related hooks (`useChartPhysicsInteraction`, `usePhysicsInteraction`) to ensure the feature works correctly when `interaction.zoomPanEnabled: true`.

4.  **`useEnhancedReducedMotion` Stability (Maximum Update Depth - Bug #27):**
    *   Fixed infinite loops caused by unstable return values/references from `useEnhancedReducedMotion` when used as a dependency in other hooks. Applied proper memoization.
    *   Fixed related loop in the `Fab` component by ensuring derived values were memoized and dependency arrays were correct.
    *   Applied best practices across the library regarding hook dependencies.

### 2. Feature Enhancements

1.  **Scroll Reveal Hook & Component:**
    *   Introduced `useScrollReveal` hook and `ScrollReveal` component (`src/hooks/useScrollReveal.ts`).
    *   Uses `IntersectionObserver`, `useEnhancedReducedMotion`, and `useGalileoStateSpring`.
    *   Provides configurable effects (`fade-up`, `zoom-in`, etc.), timing, and trigger options.
    *   Includes wrapper component for easy JSX usage.
    *   Added exports to `src/hooks/index.ts` and `src/index.ts`.

2.  **Consolidated Adaptive Quality Hook:**
    *   Created new `useAdaptiveQuality` hook (`src/hooks/useAdaptiveQuality.ts`).
    *   Consolidates device capability detection (battery, data saver, network, WebGL) and quality tier logic.
    *   Adds user override via localStorage.
    *   Deprecated and removed previous `useQualityTier` and `useDeviceCapabilities` hooks and their tests.
    *   Added exports to `src/hooks/index.ts` and `src/index.ts`.

### 3. Documentation Updates

1.  **New Feature Docs:**
    *   Created `docs/hooks/useScrollReveal.md`.
    *   Added documentation for `useAdaptiveQuality` to relevant files (`docs/animations/context-config.md`, `docs/hooks/import-paths.md`, `docs/core/framework-guide.md`).
2.  **Fix-Related Docs:**
    *   Updated documentation regarding safe usage of physics event callbacks (related to v1.0.25 fix).
    *   Updated documentation on correct usage patterns for `useEnhancedReducedMotion`.
    *   Enhanced `docs/hooks/import-paths.md` with details for physics hooks and TypeScript workarounds.
3.  **Examples:**
    *   Created `docs/examples/physics-optimization.tsx`.
    *   Created `docs/examples/gesture-physics-demo.tsx`.
4.  **Release Notes & Changelogs:**
    *   Updated `docs/releasenotes/1.0.25-fixes.md`, `docs/releasenotes/1.0.26-fixes.md`, `docs/releasenotes/1.0.27-fixes.md`.
    *   Created `docs/changelog/CHANGELOG-1.0.27.md`.
    *   Created this file (`docs/releasenotes/1.0.27-build-notes.md`).
    *   Updated main `docs/changelog/CHANGELOG.md`.

## Build Optimization Steps

- Replaced `setTimeout(0)` with `requestAnimationFrame` in `useGalileoPhysicsEngine` for more efficient scheduling of physics-driven updates.
- Applied memoization (`useMemo`, `useCallback`) more rigorously, especially in `useEnhancedReducedMotion` and `Fab`, to prevent unnecessary calculations and re-renders.
- Ensured correct dependency arrays in hooks across affected components to stabilize effects and memoized values.

## Post-Build Verification (Manual Checks Required)

- **Verify Hook Exports:**
  *   Confirm `useGesturePhysics`, `useGalileoPhysicsEngine` can be imported from the main entry point without TS/runtime errors. *(Manual verification required)*
  *   Confirm `useScrollReveal`, `ScrollReveal` can be imported from the main entry point and work as documented. *(Manual verification required)*
  *   Confirm `useAdaptiveQuality` can be imported from the main entry point and works as documented. *(Manual verification required)*
  *   Confirm deprecated hooks (`useQualityTier`, `useDeviceCapabilities`) are no longer exported/available. *(Manual verification required)*

- **Test Physics Stability:**
  *   Verify components previously affected by "Maximum update depth" errors (`GlassStepper`, physics-enabled `DataChart`, components using gestures heavily) are now stable on mount and during interaction. *(Manual verification required)*
  *   Specifically test drag interactions to ensure the `requestAnimationFrame` fix prevents high-frequency update loops. *(Manual verification required)*

- **Test DataChart Physics Zoom/Pan:**
  *   Verify that setting `interaction.zoomPanEnabled: true` correctly enables scroll-to-zoom and drag-to-pan functionality. *(Manual verification required)*

- **Test `useEnhancedReducedMotion` Usage:**
  *   Verify components using this hook (including `ScrollReveal` and `Fab`) load and function without infinite loops. *(Manual verification required)*

- **Test Scroll Reveal:**
  *   Implement `ScrollReveal` component in test scenarios with different effects and options (`triggerOnce`, `threshold`) to ensure it functions as expected. *(Manual verification required)*

- **Test Adaptive Quality:**
  *   Test `useAdaptiveQuality` hook, potentially by mocking `localStorage` or browser APIs, to verify detection logic and overrides. *(Manual verification required)*

- **Documentation Review:**
  *   Verify all new/updated documentation is accurate and reflects the implemented changes and correct import paths.
