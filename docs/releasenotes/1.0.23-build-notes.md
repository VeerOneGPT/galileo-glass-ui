## Build Process Summary

The v1.0.23 build is primarily a corrective release focused on addressing critical build configuration issues, export errors, and functional regressions introduced or discovered after v1.0.22. The main goal was to stabilize the library, ensure all documented hooks and components are correctly exported and usable, and fix major functional bugs in the animation and interaction systems. Key areas addressed include systemic build export failures, non-functional hooks like `useAnimationSequence` and `useMagneticElement`, incorrect exports for `Card` and `useParticleSystem`, and visual glitches in `DataChart`. Documentation was also updated to reflect correct usage patterns discovered during debugging.

### 1. Bug Fixes

1.  **`useParticleSystem` Hook Export (Bug #16 - v1.0.22 Regression):**
    *   Fixed build issue preventing `useParticleSystem` from being correctly exported.
    *   Ensured the hook and its types are importable from both the main entry point and `/hooks`.

2.  **`Card` Component Export (Bug #17 - v1.0.22 Regression):**
    *   Fixed build issue preventing `Card`, `CardHeader`, `CardContent`, `CardActions` from being correctly exported.
    *   Resolved "Element type is invalid... got: undefined" runtime errors.

3.  **`useChartPhysicsInteraction` Hook Export (Bug #21 - v1.0.22 Omission/Build Issue):**
    *   Fixed build configuration and export paths to ensure `useChartPhysicsInteraction` is correctly exported and bundled.
    *   Resolved `TypeError: is not a function` runtime errors when importing the hook.

4.  **`DataChart` Visual Glitches (Bug #21 - Visual Glitches):**
    *   Fixed legend cutoff issues by adjusting container layout (flexbox, min-height).
    *   Resolved layering issues where the glass/frost effect overlapped chart content by adjusting z-index and margins.

5.  **`useMagneticElement` Hook Export & Usage (Bug #19 - v1.0.22 Build/Doc Issue):**
    *   Fixed build configuration to ensure the hook is correctly exported and bundled via `./magnetic`.
    *   Corrected documentation (`magnetic-interactions.md`) to reflect the actual hook signature and usage pattern (requiring manual style construction), resolving TS/Runtime errors caused by incorrect documentation.

6.  **`usePhysicsInteraction({ type: 'magnetic' })` Fix Ineffective (Bug #19 - v1.0.23 Verification):**
    *   Corrected the internal force calculation logic for the `magnetic` type to ensure positive/negative strength correctly maps to attraction/repulsion.
    *   Verified functionality relies on the corrected `useMagneticElement` (Fix #5).

7.  **`useAnimationSequence` Hook Non-Functional (Bug #20 - v1.0.22 Regression/Build Issue):**
    *   Fixed build configuration to ensure the hook is correctly exported via `./animations/sequence`.
    *   Resolved internal type import errors within the hook and related components (`List.tsx`, etc.).
    *   **Applied core fix:** Updated initialization logic to apply initial `from` styles correctly within the play cycle (just before first frame), aiming to resolve the issue where elements failed to render. *(Manual verification still required)*.
    *   Updated documentation (`orchestration.md`) with workarounds and examples based on troubleshooting.

8.  **Build Configuration Issues with Exports (Multiple Bugs - #19, #20, #21):**
    *   **Systemic Fix:** Updated `rollup.config.js` and `package.json` exports mapping to explicitly include and expose hooks/components that were previously missing from the build output (especially nested ones).
    *   Added explicit input entries and export paths for problematic hooks (`useChartPhysicsInteraction`, `useMagneticElement`, `useAnimationSequence`).

### 2. Feature Enhancements

*   None in this release (focus was on fixes).

### 3. Documentation Updates

1.  **Corrected Usage Patterns:**
    *   Updated `docs/animations/magnetic-interactions.md` with correct usage for `useMagneticElement`.
    *   Updated `docs/animations/orchestration.md` with workarounds and corrected examples for `useAnimationSequence`.
2.  **Release Notes & Troubleshooting:**
    *   Created `docs/releasenotes/1.0.23-fixes.md` (detailed fix log).
    *   Created this file (`docs/releasenotes/1.0.23-build-notes.md`).
    *   Added examples and a troubleshooting guide to `1.0.23-fixes.md`.

## Key Artifacts Modified/Created

### Components & Hooks
- `src/hooks/usePhysicsInteraction.ts` (Fixed magnetic force calculation)
- `src/animations/orchestration/useAnimationSequence.ts` (Fixed type imports, Updated initialization logic)
- `src/components/DataChart/styles/ChartContainerStyles.ts` (Fixed layout/z-index)
- `src/components/List/List.tsx` (Corrected type import path)
- `src/animations/game/useGameAnimation.ts` (Corrected type import path)

### Types & Interfaces
- `src/animations/types.ts` (Moved types for `useAnimationSequence`)

### Build & Configuration
- `rollup.config.js` (Added explicit inputs/outputs)
- `package.json` (Updated `exports` field with specific paths)
- `src/index.ts` (Verified/corrected re-exports)
- `src/hooks/index.ts` (Verified/corrected exports)

### Documentation
- `docs/animations/magnetic-interactions.md` (Updated usage)
- `docs/animations/orchestration.md` (Updated usage/workarounds)
- `docs/releasenotes/1.0.23-fixes.md` (New - Fix Log)
- `docs/releasenotes/1.0.23-build-notes.md` (New - This file)

## Build Optimization Steps

- Primary focus was on **correcting build configuration** (`rollup.config.js`, `package.json`) to ensure all necessary code was included and exported properly.
- The fix to `useAnimationSequence` initialization (applying styles just before the first frame) may offer a slight performance improvement compared to potentially applying styles too early.

## Post-Build Verification (Manual Checks Required)

- **Verify Hook Exports:**
  *   Confirm `useParticleSystem` can be imported and used from both entry points without TS/runtime errors. *(Manual verification required)*
  *   Confirm `useChartPhysicsInteraction` can be imported and used without TS/runtime errors. *(Manual verification required)*
  *   Confirm `useMagneticElement` can be imported (from `./magnetic`) and used according to updated docs without TS/runtime errors. *(Manual verification required)*
  *   Confirm `useAnimationSequence` can be imported (from `./animations/sequence`) without TS/runtime errors. *(Manual verification required)*

- **Test Card Component:**
  *   Verify `Card`, `CardHeader`, `CardContent`, `CardActions` can be imported and render without runtime errors. *(Manual verification required)*
  *   Verify no `parallax` attribute warnings appear. *(Manual verification required)*

- **Test DataChart:**
  *   Verify legend rendering and frost effect layering issues are resolved across different chart types and container sizes. *(Manual verification required)*

- **Test Physics Interactions:**
  *   Verify `usePhysicsInteraction({ type: 'magnetic' })` now correctly applies attraction/repulsion. *(Manual verification required)*
  *   Re-evaluate if further changes are needed after testing. *(Manual verification required)*

- **Test Animation Sequence:**
  *   **CRITICAL:** Verify the core fix allows elements defined in stages to render and initialize correctly using the `from` property *without* manual workarounds. *(Manual verification required)*
  *   Verify control functions work as expected after the fix. *(Manual verification required)*

- **Documentation Review:**
  *   Verify examples and troubleshooting guide are accurate and helpful.
