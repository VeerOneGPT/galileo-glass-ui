## Build Process Summary

The v1.0.19 build focused on addressing critical type definition issues identified in v1.0.18, resolving missing exports for components and utilities, improving hook APIs and documentation based on user feedback, and continuing the stabilization of the library's build process and type generation. Most changes were concentrated in TypeScript definitions and export statements, with significant documentation updates to match implementation details.

### 1. Component Fixes & Enhancements

1.  **`GlassMultiSelect` Prop Type Definition (Bug #2):**
    - Corrected the generated type definition for the `itemRemoveAnimation` prop to accurately reflect valid animation configurations (e.g., `{ type: 'spring', preset: ... }` or `false`).
    - Updated documentation to show the correct object structure for this prop.

2.  **Component Exports (Bug #7.1):**
    - Exported `Select` and `MenuItem` components from the main entry point (`src/index.ts`).
    - Verified import paths from consuming projects.

### 2. Hook & Provider Fixes

1.  **`useAnimationSequence` Type Definition (Bug #1):**
    - Corrected the type definition for the `targets` property within `AnimationStage` to properly accept function refs and arrays containing nulls (Bug #1.1).
    - Created separate public and internal type hierarchies with `PublicBaseAnimationStage` and `PublicAnimationStage` to provide a clean, simplified API for users while maintaining internal functionality (Bug #1.2).
    - Added type converters to seamlessly translate between public and internal types without breaking existing code.
    - Updated `useAnimationSequence` hook signature to use the new public types in both parameter and return types.
    - Updated documentation to clearly document the full required and optional structure for each type of `AnimationStage`.

2.  **`use3DTransform` Type Definition (Bug #9):**
    - Addressed broken type definitions for the `use3DTransform` hook.
    - Exported the hook directly from its source file in `src/index.ts`.
    - Investigated and corrected issues preventing `Transform3DOptions` and `Transform3DState` from being importable.
    - Ensured the `Transform3DResult` type matches the source implementation.
    - Updated documentation to align with corrected type definitions and API.

3.  **Physics Hook Type Exports (Bug #6):**
    - Added export for `MagneticElementOptions` type from the top-level index.
    - Exported `useMagneticElement` hook directly from its source file.
    - Verified documentation and examples use correct terminology (`rotationAmplitude`, `tiltAmplitude`, `scaleAmplitude`).

4.  **`usePhysicsInteraction` API (Bug #7.3):**
    - Addressed potential type issues with `animationConfig` accepting preset strings.
    - Ensured options use `*Amplitude` naming convention consistently.
    - Clarified `bounds` prop usage (expects coordinate object, not a Ref) with examples.

5.  **Focus Hook Export:**
    - Ensured `useGlassFocus` hook and its associated types (`UseGlassFocusOptions`, `UseGlassFocusReturn`) are correctly exported.

6.  **Localization Utilities (Bug #10):**
    - Added exports for `GlassLocalizationProvider` and `createDateFnsAdapter` to `src/index.ts` to support date picker components.
    - Updated examples and documentation to use correct import paths.

7.  **`Point` Type Export:**
    - Changed export source for `Point` and added `Point3D` export from `src/types/physics` for consistency.
    - Removed `Point` export from `src/animations/types`.

### 3. API Verifications

1.  **`usePhysicsEngine` API Clarity (Bug #8):**
    - Verified that documentation clearly explains that `usePhysicsEngine` and `useGalileoPhysicsEngine` are identical (aliases).
    - Confirmed documentation includes import examples for both options.
    - Verified code examples show proper usage patterns.

2.  **`GlassCardLink` Documentation (Bug #4):**
    - Verified existing documentation accuracy.
    - Confirmed no API/Type mismatch existed for reported props.

### 4. Documentation & Example Updates

1.  **`GlassDataGrid` Documentation (Bug #3):**
    - Created comprehensive API documentation for the component.
    - Defined and provided TypeScript interfaces/types for Column Definitions and Cell Renderer.
    - Listed and thoroughly explained all props accepted by the component.
    - Added practical code examples.

2.  **`useAnimationSequence` Documentation:**
    - Updated to reflect the `targets` type fix.
    - Added explanations for expected `AnimationStage` structures.
    - Clarified the intentional omission of `defaults` in the return signature.
    - Detailed the recommended patterns for managing state/resetting.
    - Added comprehensive documentation for the new `PublicAnimationStage` type system.
    - Updated orchestration documentation to explain the difference between internal and public type structures.

3.  **Physics Hook Documentation:**
    - Verified documentation for `usePhysicsInteraction`, `useGesturePhysics`, `useMagneticElement` uses correct prop names.
    - Clarified `usePhysicsEngine` API details, configuration, and usage patterns.

*(Note: Build output files in `dist/` including `.d.ts` definition files will also be updated, but are not listed individually)*

## Build Optimization Steps

- The build continues to use `check: false` for `rollup-plugin-typescript2`. Type checking should be performed separately (`npm run typecheck` or IDE).
- No additional build optimizations were introduced in this patch release.

## Post-Build Verification

- Thorough type checking should be performed, especially for the fixed type definitions in `useAnimationSequence`, `use3DTransform`, and `GlassMultiSelect`.
- Verification of exports by attempting imports from a clean project setup is strongly recommended.
- Try using the public API of `useAnimationSequence` with TypeScript to confirm fixes.
- Verify type definitions for `use3DTransform` and associated types.
- Check that `MagneticElementOptions` type is properly exported and usable.
- Confirm localization utilities can be imported from the main entry point.
