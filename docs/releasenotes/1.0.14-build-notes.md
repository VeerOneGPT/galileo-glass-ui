2. **Performance with Large Datasets:**
   - `GlassDataGrid` shows performance degradation with 1000+ rows when physics animations are enabled. Recommend virtual rendering for large datasets. **Status: Open.** Needs future optimization (virtualization).

3. **Z-Space App Layout:**
   - Glass effects integration is currently limited due to mixin integration issues. **Status: Resolved.** Mixin integration confirmed in code.

4. **Pie Chart Rendering:**
   - Edge case with very small pie segments (<1%) can cause rendering artifacts in certain browsers. **Status: Unclear/Possibly Still Present.** Requires verification/testing.

5. **Build Warnings:**
   - Several "Missing exports" warnings from `@types/react` dependency - these do not affect functionality but will be addressed in future versions. **Status: Resolved.** Build logs are clean.
