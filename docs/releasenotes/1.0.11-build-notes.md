# Galileo Glass UI - Build Notes Version 1.0.11

## Build Environment

-   **Node:** [Your Node Version, e.g., v18.x.x]
-   **NPM:** [Your NPM Version, e.g., 9.x.x]
-   **Rollup:** [Rollup Version from package.json]
-   **TypeScript:** [TypeScript Version from package.json, e.g., 4.9.5]

## Build Process Summary

The build process (`npm run build`) was executed successfully after a series of debugging steps to resolve missing component exports.

1.  **Initial Failures:** The build initially failed due to numerous components used in `examples/*.tsx` not being exported from the main entry point (`src/index.ts`). Rollup reported errors like `"ComponentName" is not exported by "src/index.ts"`. TypeScript (`npx tsc --noEmit`) reported corresponding `TS2305` errors.
2.  **Systematic Export Addition:** Each missing component identified by build/type errors was located, its export type (default or named) was confirmed, and the appropriate export statement was added to `src/index.ts`. This included components like `FrostedGlass`, `DimensionalGlass`, `HeatGlass`, `WidgetGlass`, `SpeedDial*`, `Accordion*`, `TreeView*`, `ToggleButton*`, `Rating`, `ImageList*`, `KpiCard*`, `*Navigation`, `*Background`, `VisualFeedback`, etc.
3.  **Typo Correction:** An incorrect import (`OptimizedGlassContainer` instead of `PageGlassContainer`) was fixed in `examples/AdvancedComponentsDemo.tsx`.
4.  **`forwardRef` Implementation:** `React.forwardRef` was added to several components as requested, resolving potential compatibility issues and enhancing composability. Type errors encountered during this process (e.g., in `GlassMultiSelectInternal`) were addressed.
5.  **Successful Build:** After adding all necessary exports and fixing the typo, `npm run build` completed successfully (Exit Code 0).
6.  **Type Check:** `npx tsc --noEmit` confirmed that the previous `TS2305` errors related to missing exports were resolved.
7.  **Build Warnings:** The build output contained numerous warnings (`(!) Missing exports`) related to type definitions within `@types/react` and `@types/prop-types`. These were deemed non-critical for this release as they originate from external type definitions and did not prevent a successful build.

## Key Artifacts

-   `dist/index.js` (CommonJS entry point)
-   `dist/index.esm.js` (ES Module entry point)
-   `dist/index.d.ts` (Main type definitions)
-   Other bundled outputs (`core`, `theme`, `animations`, `hooks`, `components`, etc.)

## Post-Build Steps

-   Declaration file patching (`scripts/fix-declarations.js`) ran successfully.

## Known Issues/Warnings

-   Build warnings related to missing exports from `@types/react` and `@types/prop-types` persist but do not block the build. Further investigation into type dependency versions might resolve these in the future if desired.
