# Release 1.0.27 Fixes

## Integrating Fixes into Consuming Projects (e.g., gallileowebsite)

After updating `@veerone/galileo-glass-ui` (e.g., via `npm link` or installing the new version), follow these steps in your consuming project to fully integrate the fixes:

1.  **Rebuild/Restart:** Ensure you stop any running development servers, potentially clear caches (`node_modules/.cache`), reinstall dependencies (`npm install`), and restart your development environment (`npm run dev`) to pick up the linked library changes.

2.  **Fix Bug #24 (Import & Usage Issues):**
    *   **Update Imports:** Review components that use `useGalileoPhysicsEngine` or `useGesturePhysics` (like `ShootingDemoPhysicsHooks.ts` or similar).
        *   Ensure `useGalileoPhysicsEngine` is imported consistently. The recommended direct import is `import { useGalileoPhysicsEngine } from '@veerone/galileo-glass-ui';`. If TypeScript errors persist, use the `require` workaround documented in `docs/hooks/import-paths.md`.
        *   Ensure `useGesturePhysics` is imported directly: `import { useGesturePhysics } from '@veerone/galileo-glass-ui';`.
    *   **Update `useGesturePhysics` Implementation:** In your shooting demo (`ShootingDemoPhysicsHooks.ts` or equivalent), replace any manual pointer event fallbacks with the intended `useGesturePhysics` logic. Refer to the new example `docs/examples/gesture-physics-demo.tsx` for the correct structure, including:
        *   Using the `pan.onStart`, `pan.onChange`, and `pan.onEnd` callbacks.
        *   Calculating velocity from gesture movement in `onEnd`.
        *   Applying the calculated impulse using `physicsApi.applyImpulse`.
    *   **Address TypeScript Workarounds (If Needed):** If you encounter TypeScript errors with event types or refs in `useGesturePhysics`, apply the workarounds documented in `docs/hooks/import-paths.md` (using `any` for events, type assertions for refs, optional chaining for properties).
    *   **Verify `Card` Usage:** Ensure you are using `import { Card } from '@veerone/galileo-glass-ui';`. The `GlassCard` alias also works.

3.  **Fix Bug #25 (Maximum Update Depth):**
    *   The internal library fix (throttling in `useGalileoPhysicsEngine`) should prevent errors originating *within* the library.
    *   **Apply Best Practices:** Review your components that frequently update state based on physics data (like `ShootingDemo.tsx` updating trajectory, or the component updating ball position/rotation from the physics loop in `ShootingDemoPhysicsHooks.ts`). Apply the state update throttling techniques demonstrated in `docs/examples/physics-optimization.tsx`:
        *   Use `requestAnimationFrame` for scheduling state updates based on physics loop data.
        *   Throttle updates (e.g., only call `setState` every N frames or based on a minimum time interval).
        *   Use `useRef` to track update status and prevent accidental update loops.

4.  **Fix Bug #27 (useEnhancedReducedMotion):**
    *   **Re-enable Hook:** In the component where `useEnhancedReducedMotion` was previously removed or disabled (e.g., a custom `useGalileoScrollReveal` hook), re-enable its usage.
    *   **Apply Best Practices:** Ensure you are following the usage patterns documented in `docs/animations/accessibility.md`:
        *   Extract primitive values (like `prefersReducedMotion: boolean`) from the hook's return object if used in dependency arrays (`useEffect`, `useCallback`, `useMemo`). Avoid putting the entire returned object in dependency arrays.
    *   **Check For Similar Issues:** Review your components that use `useEnhancedReducedMotion` for similar patterns that might cause infinite update loops:
        *   In the library, we found and fixed this issue in the `Fab` component, where derived values from the hook's result were not properly memoized
        *   Look for places where values returned by this hook are used directly in `useMemo` dependency arrays
        *   Wrap any calculations that derive from hook results with `useMemo` with proper dependency tracking

5.  **Testing:** Thoroughly test the affected features:
    *   The shooting mechanics in your `ShootingDemo`.
    *   Components using scroll reveal or `useEnhancedReducedMotion`.
    *   Any other components heavily reliant on the physics engine or gesture hooks.

## Bug Fixes & Tasks

- [x] **Bug #24: Core Hooks (`useGesturePhysics`, `useGalileoPhysicsEngine`) Unavailable / Not Exported**
  - **Issue:** Core hooks cannot be reliably imported/used from the main package entry point even after clean build/relink.
    - `useGesturePhysics`: Causes runtime `TypeError: ... is not a function` when imported directly.
    - `useGalileoPhysicsEngine`: Causes linter error (no exported member) when imported directly (works via adapter `@/hooks/adapters`).
  - **Impact:** Prevents implementation of gesture-based physics interactions (`ShootingDemo`) and forces adapter usage for engine hook.
  - **Status Update:** Fixed by updating exports and properly documenting the correct import paths. The hooks are now properly exported from both the main package and their respective subpaths.
  - **Known TypeScript Issues:** TypeScript declarations may still show errors for these hooks. We've documented workarounds in `docs/hooks/import-paths.md` including:
    - Using dynamic `require()` for imports that TypeScript doesn't recognize
    - Using type assertions for incompatible event parameter types
    - Safely accessing event properties with optional chaining
  - **Resolution Steps / Tasks:**
    - [x] **(Library)** Fixed exports in `src/hooks/index.ts` to point to the full implementation of `useGesturePhysics` in the physics directory
    - [x] **(Library)** Updated documentation for importing `useGesturePhysics`, `useGalileoPhysicsEngine`, and confirmed `Card`/`GlassCard` usage
    - [x] **(Library)** Created detailed example in `docs/examples/gesture-physics-demo.tsx` showing correct hook usage with physics engine
    - [x] **(Library)** Enhanced `docs/hooks/import-paths.md` to clearly document the supported import paths for all hooks
    - [x] **(Library)** Added TypeScript workarounds for known declaration issues in example code

- [x] **Bug #25: Maximum Update Depth Exceeded During Gameplay/Interaction**
  - **Issue:** React infinite render loop ("Maximum update depth exceeded") occurs during high-frequency interactions (e.g., mouse drag) in `ShootingDemo`, even after throttling application-level state updates.
  - **Impact:** Makes the `ShootingDemo` application unstable and unusable during core interactions.
  - **Status Update:** Fixed by replacing problematic setTimeout(0) with requestAnimationFrame and implementing proper update throttling in the physics engine.
  - **Resolution Steps / Tasks:**
    - [x] **(Library)** Fixed issue in `useGalileoPhysicsEngine` where setTimeout(0) was causing asynchronous state updates during physics steps
    - [x] **(Library)** Implemented proper throttling using requestAnimationFrame and a minimum update interval to prevent excessive updates
    - [x] **(Library)** Created detailed example in `docs/examples/physics-optimization.tsx` showing best practices for state updates with physics
    - [x] **(Library)** Added render throttling mechanisms to prevent maximum update depth errors during high-frequency events

- [x] **Bug #27: Maximum Update Depth Exceeded on Load (useEnhancedReducedMotion Issue)**
  - **Issue:** "Maximum update depth exceeded" error occurs immediately on page load for components using a custom `useGalileoScrollReveal` hook, after refactoring it to use `useEnhancedReducedMotion`.
  - **Impact:** Prevents pages using scroll reveal components from loading. Workaround (disabling reduced motion check) ignores user preference.
  - **Status Update:** Error resolved by removing `useEnhancedReducedMotion` call in the custom hook. Strongly indicates an instability in the library hook during initial render cycles when used as a dependency.
  - **Resolution Steps / Tasks:**
    - [x] **(Library)** Investigate stability of `useEnhancedReducedMotion`. Does it return unstable values/references on initial render that cause dependency loops in `useEffect` or other hooks?
    - [x] **(Library)** Fixed stability issues in `useEnhancedReducedMotion` by adding proper memoization to the return value and making other optimizations to prevent render loops.
    - [x] **(Library)** Added documentation with proper usage patterns for using `useEnhancedReducedMotion` to avoid "Maximum update depth exceeded" errors.
    - [x] **(Library)** Fixed additional Maximum Update Depth error in the `Fab` component by properly memoizing derived values from `useEnhancedReducedMotion` and ensuring correct dependency array usage in all `useMemo` hooks.
    - [x] **(Library)** Applied best practices for hook usage across the codebase, extracting primitive values from complex hook returns and avoiding unstable object references in dependency arrays.

- [x] **Enhancement: Consolidated Device Capability Detection and Quality Tier Management**
  - **Change:** Deprecated and removed `useQualityTier` and `useDeviceCapabilities` hooks, replacing them with a single consolidated `useAdaptiveQuality` hook.
  - **Impact:** Provides a single, more powerful API for performance optimization, with improved capabilities including:
    - User preference override via localStorage
    - Battery saving mode detection

  - **Impact:** Provides an easy way to add common scroll-triggered entrance animations (fade, slide, zoom) using IntersectionObserver and spring physics.
  - **Features:**
    - Configurable effects and animation parameters (via `SpringPresets` or custom config).
    - Options for trigger threshold, root margin, and triggering once.
    - Automatically respects user's `prefersReducedMotion` setting.
    - Includes `ScrollReveal` wrapper component for declarative usage.
  - **Status Update:** Implementation completed. Hook and component are exported and documented.
  - **Tasks Completed:**
    - [x] **(Library)** Created `src/hooks/useScrollReveal.ts` implementing the hook and component.
    - [x] **(Library)** Renamed from initial `use-galileo-scroll-reveal.tsx`.
