## Build Process Summary

The v1.0.21 build introduces several substantial new features to the Galileo Glass UI library, focusing on animations, physics interactions, dimensional effects, and accessibility. This release also addresses a significant bug in the `usePhysicsInteraction` hook involving keyframe animations. The build includes new components and hooks that enhance the library's capabilities for creating immersive, physically realistic UI experiences while maintaining strong accessibility support. Documentation has been expanded to cover all new features.

### 1. Bug Fixes

1. **`usePhysicsInteraction` Keyframe Error (Bug #14):**
   * Fixed error: "It seems you are interpolating a keyframe declaration (...) into an untagged string" that occurred when using the hook in consuming applications.
   * Ensured that dynamically generated `styled-components` keyframes are correctly wrapped with the `css` helper function (`` css`...` ``).
   * Verified the fix by adding a test case using `affectsScale` and testing in consuming applications.

### 2. Animation & Physics Features

1. **Particle System Implementation:**
   * Created `useParticleSystem` hook for controlling particle-based animations.
   * Implemented core particle engine in `src/animations/particles/particleEngine.ts`.
   * Built efficient rendering systems for Canvas and WebGL in `src/animations/particles/renderers/`.
   * Implemented comprehensive physics system for particle movement, including gravity, wind, friction, and attractors/repulsors.
   * Created preset configurations for common effects (fireworks, snow, rain, confetti, etc.).
   * Integrated with accessibility features (respects reduced motion) and performance optimizations (object pooling, adaptive quality tiers).

2. **Magnetic Interactions:**
   * Implemented `useMagneticElement` hook in `src/hooks/useMagneticElement.ts`.
   * Created core physics logic for magnetic forces in `src/animations/physics/magneticPhysics.ts`.
   * Implemented pointer tracking for position-relative magnetic effects.
   * Added support for pointer following with configurable physics behavior.
   * Added snap points for alignment with defined positions.
   * Implemented directional fields for angle-dependent magnetic forces.
   * Created multi-element magnetic systems for interconnected effects.

3. **Gesture Physics & Inertial Movement:**
   * Implemented `useGesturePhysics` hook for physics-based interactions with user gestures.
   * Created `useInertialMovement` hook for momentum-based animations after interaction.
   * Integrated haptic feedback capabilities via a new `src/utils/haptics.ts` utility.
   * Implemented spring physics for natural-feeling movement with configurable parameters.

4. **Dimensional Effects (Z-Space, 3D, Parallax):**
   * Created `useZSpace` hook for managing elements in 3D space.
   * Implemented `use3DTransform` hook for 3D transformations with physics.
   * Developed `useParallaxScroll` hook for scroll-based parallax effects.
   * Added support for scroll-linked animations and depth effects.
   * Integrated Z-position with other effects (blur, scale) for realistic depth simulation.

### 3. Accessibility & Performance Features

1. **Enhanced Accessibility Controls:**
   * Implemented Motion Sensitivity Levels system (`LOW`, `MEDIUM`, `HIGH`, `NONE`).
   * Created Animation Categories framework (`ESSENTIAL`, `TRANSITION`, etc.).
   * Implemented Alternative Animations system (Fade, Static, Simplified variants).
   * Modified core animation hooks/components to access `recommendedSensitivityLevel` from `useEnhancedReducedMotion`.
   * Updated core components to implement alternative visual representations when `prefersReducedMotion` is true.

2. **Adaptive Performance Controls:**
   * Implemented `useAdaptiveQuality` hook for device capability detection and quality tier determination.
   * Updated `AnimationContext` to provide configuration options for quality tiers.
   * Modified computationally intensive components (especially `useParticleSystem`) to adjust behavior based on detected or forced quality tier.

### 4. New Components

1. **`GlassFocusRing` Component:**
   * Created component in `src/components/GlassFocusRing/`.
   * Implemented props for customization: color, variant, offset, thickness, borderRadius, disabled.
   * Built with deep accessibility consideration to enhance keyboard navigation.
   * Added support for composition with any focusable element.
   * Integrated with `useGlassFocus` hook for core functionality.

### 5. Documentation Improvements

1. **Updated Documentation:**
   * `docs/animations/particle-system.md`: Updated to reflect implemented attractors/repulsors functionality and quality tier integration.
   * `docs/animations/gesture-physics.md`: Updated to document the completed useGesturePhysics hook and haptic feedback integration.
   * `docs/animations/accessibility.md`: Removed "Concept" designation from Motion Sensitivity Levels and Animation Categories, added references to new hooks.
   * `docs/animations/magnetic-interactions.md`: Updated to document the implemented Directional Fields and Multi-Element Systems features.
   * `docs/animations/dimensional-effects.md`: Updated to document the implemented useParallaxScroll hook and physics integration for 3D transforms.

2. **New Documentation:**
   * `docs/animations/alternative-animations.md`: New documentation for the alternative animations system, including useAlternativeAnimations hook and withAlternativeAnimations HOC.
   * `docs/components/GlassFocusRing.md`: New documentation for the GlassFocusRing component, explaining usage, props, and examples.

- Considered performance implications for the particle system rendering, implementing adaptive quality tiers.
- Added object pooling for particles to minimize garbage collection.
- Optimized transform matrix calculations for 3D transforms.
- Ensured all animation hooks respect the user's motion preferences.
