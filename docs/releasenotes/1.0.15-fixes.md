# Galileo Glass UI v1.0.15 - PRD: Planned Fixes

This document outlines the requirements for fixes planned for the `v1.0.15` patch release of the Galileo Glass UI library.

---

## 1. Fix: DataChart Pie Chart Rendering Artifacts

**Goal:** Resolve the rendering artifact issue for very small segments (<1%) in Pie Charts within the `GlassDataChart` component.
**Status: Completed (Pending Testing)** // Fix implemented, testing required

**Requirements:**

*   Identify the root cause of the rendering artifact when displaying extremely small (<1%) pie chart segments.
*   Investigate potential solutions within the Chart.js configuration options (`options.elements.arc` perhaps?) or custom drawing logic (plugins).
*   Possible approaches:
    *   Adjust Chart.js arc configuration (`borderWidth`, `circumference` calculation).
    *   Implement a minimum visual angle/size for segments, potentially grouping very small segments into an "Other" category visually or in the tooltip.
    *   Override arc drawing logic with a custom plugin if necessary.
*   Verify the fix across different browsers and data scenarios.
*   Add tests specifically targeting small segment rendering.

**Files to Update/Create:**

*   `src/components/DataChart/GlassDataChart.tsx`: // Implemented Fix
*   `src/components/DataChart/utils/ChartDataUtils.ts` (Potentially): If data transformation is needed.
*   `src/components/DataChart/plugins/*` (Potentially): If a custom plugin is required.
*   `src/components/DataChart/GlassDataChart.test.tsx` or similar: Add new tests.
*   `examples/components/GlassDataChart.stories.tsx`: Add a story showcasing very small pie segments.

**Tasks:**

*   [X] Reproduce the rendering artifact with a minimal test case (data with very small segments).
*   [X] Analyze Chart.js rendering behavior for small arcs.
*   [X] Research Chart.js options related to arc drawing (`borderWidth`, `offset`, `spacing`, minimum angle?).
*   [X] Experiment with configuration options to resolve the artifact. // Implemented setting borderWidth: 0
*   [X] If config options fail, design and implement data pre-processing or a custom drawing plugin. // Config option applied
*   [ ] Test the fix in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge. // External Testing Pending
*   [X] Add specific Jest tests for pie charts with small segments.
*   [X] Add a Storybook example demonstrating the fixed behavior.
*   [ ] Update relevant documentation if the fix involves new configurations or noticeable behavior changes. // No changes needed

**Status: Completed** // Verified: Task previously marked complete, changes noted in PRD
**Reference:** Galileo Website Bug Report - Conflict 1

**Requirements:**

*   Investigate the correct structure and properties required for the `stages` array and its constituent stage objects (`StyleAnimationStage`, `CallbackAnimationStage`, `GroupAnimationStage`, `StaggerAnimationStage`, etc.) as implemented in `useOrchestration` v1.0.14+.
*   Determine the correct usage/placement of properties like `delay` and `dependencies` within the stage configuration.
*   Verify if the current TypeScript definitions (`.d.ts`) accurately reflect the hook's implementation.
*   Verify if the documentation accurately reflects the hook's implementation and type definitions.
*   Update the implementation, type definitions, and/or documentation to ensure consistency and correctness.

**Status: Completed (Pending Testing)** // Implemented, testing required

**Requirements:**

*   Analyze the internal CSS (likely styled-components) of `GlassTabs`, focusing on how width, flex properties, padding, and margins are applied to the main container, tab list, individual tabs, and the active indicator.
*   Identify potential causes for the reported issues when nested in Flexbox/Grid (e.g., specificity conflicts, inflexible width calculations, lack of alignment controls).
*   Evaluate the component's responsiveness strategy (if any) and its limitations in constrained environments.
*   Propose and implement solutions:
    *   Potentially expose new props for controlling width distribution (e.g., `variant='fill'`, `variant='scrollable'`, `tabWidth='auto'`), alignment (`alignItems`), or spacing.
    *   Refactor internal styling to be more flexible or easier to override via standard CSS or theme mechanisms.
    *   Ensure the active indicator calculation works correctly even when tab widths are dynamic or constrained.
*   Provide clear documentation and examples demonstrating how to integrate `GlassTabs` into common complex layouts like responsive headers, including recommended styling and customization patterns.

*   [X] Refactor CSS or component logic to prevent shifts (e.g., pre-calculate widths, use transform for animation, stabilize container dimensions).
*   [X] Ensure the active tab indicator (`::after` or separate element) correctly positions itself relative to the active tab label, accounting for padding, margins, and dynamic widths.
*   [ ] Add specific tests (Jest/RTL, Storybook) for initial render, content change scenarios, and indicator positioning. // External Testing Pending
*   [ ] Verify the fix across supported browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
*   [X] Update documentation (`docs/components/glass-tabs.md`) if the fix involves API changes or important implementation details.

**Reference:** Galileo Website Bug Report - Conflict 11

**Requirements:**

*   Identify types required for strongly-typed usage of component props/callbacks (e.g., `DateRange` for `GlassDateRangePicker`).
*   Export these types from the main library entry point or relevant submodule.
*   Ensure documentation references the correct, exported types.

**Files to Update/Create:**

*   `src/index.ts` (Add type exports).
*   `src/components/DateRangePicker/types.ts` (Ensure type is defined).
*   `docs/components/glass-date-range-picker.md` (Update type references).

**Tasks:**

*   [X] Confirm `DateRange` type is missing from main exports. // Verified
*   [X] Locate `DateRange` type definition (likely in `src/components/DateRangePicker/types.ts`). // Verified path exists
*   [X] Add `DateRange` export to `src/index.ts` (or relevant component index/barrel file). // Verified export added
*   [X] Verify `MultiSelectOption` is correctly exported (already confirmed).
*   [ ] Audit other components for potentially missing prop type exports.
*   [X] Update documentation to use exported types. // Verified date-range docs

## 15. Fix: `useQualityTier` Hook / `QualityTier` Type Not Found/Exported

**Goal:** Clarify the status and intended usage of `useQualityTier` / `QualityTier` and either export them or update docs.
**Status: Not Started**
**Reference:** Galileo Website Bug Report - Conflict 12

**Requirements:**

*   Determine if `useQualityTier` and `QualityTier` are intended for public use.
*   If yes, export them from the correct path (e.g., main entry or `/hooks`).
*   If no (internal only), update documentation mentioning adaptive quality to reflect how it's controlled (e.g., via component props) without referencing the internal hook/type directly.

**Files to Update/Create:**

*   `src/index.ts` / `src/hooks/index.ts` (Add exports if public).
*   `src/components/DataChart/hooks/useQualityTier.ts` (Verify source).
*   `docs/*` (Update docs based on public/internal decision).

**Tasks:**

*   [X] Confirm hook/type exist internally but are not exported. // Verified
*   [X] Decide if `useQualityTier`/`QualityTier` should be public API. // Decision: Internal
*   [ ] If public: Add exports to relevant index files and verify build. // N/A
*   [X] If internal: Audit documentation (e.g., DataChart) and remove direct references; explain adaptive quality through component props instead. // Verified docs OK
*   [ ] Add tests if made public. // N/A

## 16. Fix: `useDeviceCapabilities` Hook Not Found/Exported

**Goal:** Clarify the status and intended usage of `useDeviceCapabilities` and either export it or update docs.
**Status: Not Started**
**Reference:** Galileo Website Bug Report - Conflict 13

**Requirements:**

*   Determine if `useDeviceCapabilities` is intended for public use.
*   If yes, export it from the correct path.
*   If no (internal only or deprecated), update any documentation or code relying on it.

**Files to Update/Create:**

*   `src/index.ts` / `src/hooks/index.ts` (Add exports if public).
*   `src/animations/performance/useDeviceCapabilities.ts` (Verify source).
*   `docs/*` / `src/*` (Update docs/code based on public/internal decision).

**Tasks:**

*   [X] Confirm hook exists internally but is not exported. // Verified
*   [X] Decide if `useDeviceCapabilities` should be public API. // Decision: Internal/Deprecated
*   [ ] If public: Add exports to relevant index files and verify build. // N/A
*   [ ] If internal/deprecated: Audit documentation and codebase for references and remove/replace them.
*   [ ] Add tests if made public. // N/A

## 17. Fix: `usePhysicsInteraction` API Change (Missing `eventHandlers`)

**Goal:** Address the breaking change in `usePhysicsInteraction` return value (missing `eventHandlers`) and document the new pattern.
**Status: Not Started**
**Reference:** Galileo Website Bug Report - Conflict 14

**Requirements:**

*   Confirm the removal of `eventHandlers` is intentional.
*   Document the intended way to handle pointer events (hover, click, drag) for elements using the hook in v1.0.14+. (e.g., are interactions automatic via `ref`, or does the user need to add their own listeners?).
*   Provide clear code examples of the new pattern.
*   Update existing examples/documentation that might use the old pattern.

**Files to Update/Create:**

*   `src/hooks/usePhysicsInteraction.ts` (Verify return signature).
*   `docs/hooks/physics-interaction.md` (Update documentation with new pattern).
*   `examples/*` (Update examples).

**Tasks:**

*   [X] Confirm `eventHandlers` is missing from return signature. // Verified
*   [X] Determine the intended interaction pattern for v1.0.14+ (automatic via ref? manual listeners?) // Verified: Automatic via ref
*   [X] Update documentation (`docs/hooks/physics-interaction.md`) to explain the removal and demonstrate the correct v1.0.14+ interaction pattern. // Verified docs updated
*   [ ] Audit examples and update any using the old `eventHandlers` pattern.
*   [ ] Add/update tests to reflect the new interaction pattern.
