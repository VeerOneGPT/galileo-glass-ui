- Improved accessibility with proper reduced motion preference handling
- Improved TypeScript typing and interface definitions

### Comprehensive Animation System Overhaul

Version 1.0.5 introduces a completely redesigned, physics-based animation system, replacing previous methods (like basic CSS transitions or external libraries like Framer Motion) with a powerful, integrated, and performant solution built from the ground up for Galileo Glass UI.

**Core Features:**
- **Integrated Physics Engine:** A central system (`galileoPhysicsSystem.ts`) manages highly configurable spring physics (tension, friction, mass), an advanced collision system (spatial grid, various shapes, filtering, accurate rebounding), global forces (gravity), and crucial performance optimizations like object sleeping for inactive elements.
- **Adaptive Performance:** Intelligently detects device capabilities and automatically adjusts animation complexity, physics precision, and effect fidelity using the `useAdaptiveQuality` hook to ensure smooth 60fps performance across a wide range of hardware.
- **New Interaction & State Hooks:**
    - `usePhysicsInteraction`: Apply rich, physics-based feedback (spring, magnetic effects, subtle scaling/rotation) to elements responding to pointer events (hover, press). Highly configurable.
    - `useGalileoStateSpring`: Smoothly animate single numerical values (like opacity or height) between states using spring physics. Respects reduced motion.
    - `useMultiSpring`: Animate vectors (objects containing multiple numerical values like `{x, y, scale}`) concurrently using coordinated springs. Ideal for complex `transform` animations.
- **Gesture Physics:** `useGesturePhysics` provides natural-feeling, physics-based responses to user gestures (touch, mouse, pointer) across devices, including realistic inertia for flick scrolling/swiping and support for multi-touch gestures (pinch, rotate).
- **Animation Orchestration:** `useAnimationSequence` enables the creation of complex, multi-step animation sequences with precise timing control, stage dependencies (`dependsOn`), advanced staggering patterns (sequential, center-out, wave, custom), grouping, repetition, and lifecycle hooks.
- **Advanced Accessibility:** The enhanced `useReducedMotion` hook goes beyond simple detection, offering app-level overrides, configurable motion sensitivity levels (Low, Medium, High), distinct animation categories (Essential, Transition, Feedback, Decorative, etc.), and preferred alternative animations (Fade, Static, Simplified) â€“ all persisted in `localStorage`.
- **Specialized Effects:** The system includes hooks and utilities for creating sophisticated visual effects like Z-space management (`useZSpace.ts`), 3D perspective transforms (`use3DTransform.ts`), parallax scrolling effects, GPU-accelerated particle systems, and realistic reflection/shadow effects integrated with the glass aesthetic.
- **Component Integration:** A wide range of core interactive components (including Inputs like `Button`, `TextField`, `Select`; Navigation like `Tabs`, `Drawer`, `TreeView`; Feedback like `Modal`, `Dialog`, `Snackbar`, `Tooltip`; Data Display like `Card`, `ImageList`) have been refactored to utilize the new animation hooks, ensuring consistent, high-quality, physics-based interactions and transitions throughout the library.
- **Animation Context:** `AnimationProvider` and `useAnimationContext` enable global configuration of default animation settings and spring presets (e.g., 'GENTLE', 'WOBBLY', 'MODAL_TRANSITION', 'PRESS_FEEDBACK'), promoting consistency and simplifying component usage.

**Benefits:**
- **Natural & Engaging Feel:** Animations are significantly more organic, responsive, and satisfying due to the underlying physics.
- **Optimized Performance:** Designed for speed, leveraging GPU acceleration and adaptive quality scaling to maintain smooth frame rates.
- **Consistency:** Establishes a unified, robust system for all animations within the library, replacing disparate methods.
- **Enhanced Accessibility:** Provides comprehensive, fine-grained control over motion to respect user needs and preferences.
- **Developer Experience:** Offers intuitive, well-documented hooks (`usePhysicsInteraction`, `useAnimationSequence`, etc.) and clear configuration patterns via props and context.
- **Reduced Dependencies:** Eliminates reliance on external animation libraries like Framer Motion.
- **Maintainability:** Centralized physics and animation logic improves code organization and simplifies future enhancements.

**New Documentation:**
- Detailed guides for the core physics hooks, orchestration, context configuration, and accessibility features are now available in the `docs/animations` directory.

### TypeScript and API Improvements
- Created a ref API with useful methods like getChartInstance, exportChart, and updateChart
- Added null-safe defaults for SVG attributes to prevent "undefined" errors
- Made hex-to-RGB color conversion safer with fallback values
- Added fallbacks for optional animation properties
