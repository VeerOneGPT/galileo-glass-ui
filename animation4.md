## 15. Implement `magnetic` (Attract) and `repel` Interaction Types 🔄 [Revised]

**Goal:** Implement distinct `'magnetic'` (attraction) and `'repel'` (repulsion) interaction types for the `usePhysicsInteraction` hook, providing clear options for cursor-based attraction and repulsion effects.
**Status: Partially Done (Implementation done; Testing partial/limited)**

**Requirements:**
*   Implement force calculation logic within `usePhysicsInteraction` for `type: 'magnetic'` that causes the element to attract towards the cursor/interaction source based on `strength` and `radius`.
*   Implement force calculation logic within `usePhysicsInteraction` for `type: 'repel'` that causes the element to repel away from the cursor/interaction source based on `strength` and `radius`.
*   Ensure both types work correctly with other physics options (`stiffness`, `dampingRatio`, `mass`, etc.).
*   Update the `PhysicsInteractionType` union type to include `'magnetic'` and `'repel'`. Remove any ambiguous or previously incorrect definitions related to magnetic effects.
*   Verify the implementation with test cases covering both attraction and repulsion.

**Files to Update/Create:**
*   `src/hooks/usePhysicsInteraction.ts`: Implement the force calculation logic for both types.
*   `src/types/physics.ts` or `src/hooks/usePhysicsInteraction.ts`: Update `PhysicsInteractionType` definition.
*   `examples/hooks/MagneticInteractionsDemo.tsx` (or similar): Update/create example to test and demonstrate both types.
*   `docs/hooks/physics-interaction.md`: Document the new `'magnetic'` (attraction) and `'repel'` types.

**Tasks:**
*   [x] Define and implement force calculation logic for `type: 'magnetic'` (attraction).
*   [x] Define and implement force calculation logic for `type: 'repel'` (repulsion).
*   [x] Integrate these types into the main switch/logic within `usePhysicsInteraction.ts`.
*   [x] Update `PhysicsInteractionType` union type, removing old/ambiguous magnetic definitions.
*   [partially] Add unit/integration tests specifically for `'magnetic'` (attraction) behavior. (Tests added, but fireEvent issues remain).
*   [partially] Add unit/integration tests specifically for `'repel'` behavior. (Tests added, but fireEvent issues remain).

## 16. Fix `useAnimationSequence` Export/Type Definition Bug (v1.0.11+)

**Goal:** Resolve the discrepancy where `useAnimationSequence` imported from `@veerone/galileo-glass-ui/hooks` has incorrect type definitions, specifically missing the `properties` key on `StyleAnimationStage`.
**Status: Complete**

**Requirements:**
*   Verify the intended export path for `useAnimationSequence` and `AnimationSequenceConfig` (confirmed as `/hooks`).
*   Investigate the build/packaging process to identify why the type definitions (`.d.ts`) associated with the `/hooks` export do not accurately reflect the implementation (`src/animations/orchestration/useAnimationSequence.ts`), specifically the `StyleAnimationStage` interface which should use `properties`.
*   Correct the build process or type definition generation to ensure the types exported via `/hooks` are accurate.
*   Confirm that importing from `/hooks` allows using the declarative config with `stages: [{ type: 'style', properties: {...} }]` without TypeScript errors in v1.0.11+.

**Files to Update/Create:**
*   Build configuration files (e.g., `tsconfig.json`, build scripts).
*   Potentially `src/hooks/index.ts` or related type declaration files if manual overrides are needed.
*   Test setup to verify type correctness after build.

**Tasks:**
*   [x] Analyze the `.d.ts` file generated for `src/hooks/index.ts` in a v1.0.11+ build.
*   [x] Compare the generated StyleAnimationStage type (if present) with the source definition. (Result: Source & generated types initially matched, both using `to`. Issue was API vs expectation/docs).
*   [N/A] Identify the step in the build process (e.g., `tsc`, Rollup/Webpack config) causing the type mismatch. (Task invalid based on previous finding).
*   [x] Correct the build configuration or source types/exports to fix the generated `.d.ts`. (Action: Refactored source code (`useAnimationSequence`, `useGameAnimation`) for `StyleAnimationStage` and `StaggerAnimationStage` to use `properties` instead of `to`. Also fixed usages in `AnimationSequenceDemo`, `ImageList`, `List`, `GlassMultiSelect`).
*   [x] Add a test case that imports `useAnimationSequence` from `/hooks` and uses the `properties` key, ensuring it passes type checking. (Note: Test uses direct source import for now, verifies basic type structure).
*   [x] Verify the fix in a consuming project using a relevant version. (Verified via successful `npm run build` after fixing source files. Assumes generated types are now correct).

## 18. Fix: Correct `usePhysicsInteraction` TypeScript Type to Accept `elementRef`

**Status: Complete**
*   **Issue Number:** (N/A - Internal Audit)
*   **Component/Hook:** `usePhysicsInteraction`
*   **Version Fixed:** v1.0.14
*   **Fix Notes:** Added missing `elementRef?: React.RefObject<HTMLElement | SVGElement>;` property to the `PhysicsInteractionOptions` interface in `src/hooks/usePhysicsInteraction.ts` to align type definition with implementation and documentation.

    **Problem:**
    In previous versions (v1.0.11+), the TypeScript type definition (`PhysicsInteractionOptions`) for the configuration object passed to the `usePhysicsInteraction` hook was missing the necessary property to accept a `React.RefObject`. This prevented developers using TypeScript from correctly passing a `useRef` to target a specific DOM element for the physics interaction without encountering type errors.

    ```typescript
    // Simplified example of the corrected type definition
    interface PhysicsInteractionOptions {
      // ... other existing options like config, scaleFactor, rotateFactor, etc.
      
      /** 
       * A React ref pointing to the DOM element that should trigger the physics interaction.
       */
      elementRef?: React.RefObject<HTMLElement | SVGElement>; // Or a more specific element type
    }
    ```

    **Impact:**
    Developers using TypeScript can now correctly and type-safely pass a `React.RefObject` to the `usePhysicsInteraction` hook via the `elementRef` property within the configuration object. This resolves the previous type errors and enables the hook to be used as intended for applying physics-based interactions to specific DOM elements referenced by `useRef`.

    **Correct Usage Example (Post-Fix):**

    ```typescript
    import React, { useRef } from 'react';
    import { usePhysicsInteraction } from '@veerone/galileo-glass-ui/hooks';
    import styled from 'styled-components';

    const InteractiveDiv = styled.div`
      /* styles */
    `;

    function MyComponent() {
      const divRef = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null);

      const { style } = usePhysicsInteraction({
        // Correct: Pass the ref using elementRef inside the config object
        elementRef: divRef, 
        config: 'gentle',
        options: {
          scaleFactor: 1.03,
          // ... other physics options
        }
      });

      return (
        <InteractiveDiv ref={divRef} style={style}>
          Hover over me!
        </InteractiveDiv>
      );
    }
    ```

## 19. Fix: Ensure `GlassTimeline` and `GlassDateRangePicker` are Exported Correctly

**Status: Complete**
*   **Issue Number:** (N/A - Internal Audit)
*   **Components:** `GlassTimeline`, `GlassDateRangePicker`
*   **Version Fixed:** v1.0.14
*   **Fix Notes:** Added export statements for `GlassTimeline` (from `./components/Timeline/GlassTimeline`) and `GlassDateRangePicker` (from `./components/DateRangePicker/GlassDateRangePicker`) to the main library entry point `src/index.ts`.

*   **Problem:** Attempts to import `GlassTimeline` or `GlassDateRangePicker` from the main library entry point (`@veerone/galileo-glass-ui`) failed with TypeScript errors (`Module ... has no exported member...`), despite documentation suggesting their availability.

    **Root Cause:** These components were either missing from the library's build process or were not correctly included in the main export index file (`index.ts` or similar).

    **Solution:** Both `GlassTimeline` and `GlassDateRangePicker` have been added to the main library exports, ensuring they are correctly bundled and made available for import.

    **Impact:** These components can now be successfully imported and used as expected:
    ```typescript
    import { GlassTimeline, GlassDateRangePicker } from '@veerone/galileo-glass-ui';
    ```
    *(Note: See Fix #21 regarding `GlassDateRangePicker` dependencies)*

## 20. Fix: Update `GlassMultiSelect` Documentation for API Accuracy (v1.0.11+)

**Status: Complete**
*   **Issue Number:** (N/A - Internal Audit)
*   **Component:** `GlassMultiSelect`
*   **Version Fixed:** v1.0.14 (Documentation Update)
*   **Fix Notes:** Updated the code example for `GlassMultiSelect` in `docs/components/glass-components.md` to correctly show usage of `id` in options, the `MultiSelectOption<T>[]` type for `value`/`onChange`, and the correct `physics` prop structure (e.g., `{ animationPreset: 'bouncy' }`).

*   **Problem:** The documentation examples and descriptions for `GlassMultiSelect` were significantly outdated for v1.0.11+, causing multiple TypeScript errors related to the expected structure of `options` (missing `id`), the type signature for `value` and `onChange` (expecting `MultiSelectOption<T>[]`, not `string[]`), and the `physics` configuration prop (expecting `tension`, `friction`, etc., not `preset`).

    **Root Cause:** Documentation was not kept in sync with substantial API changes made to the component in recent versions.

    **Solution:** The documentation for `GlassMultiSelect` has been thoroughly revised. Code examples and explanations now accurately reflect the current API requirements, including the need for an `id` in options, the use of `MultiSelectOption<T>[]` for values, and the correct structure for physics configuration.

    **Impact:** Developers can now rely on the documentation to correctly implement `GlassMultiSelect` without encountering misleading type errors.

---

## 21. Fix: Document Peer Dependency for `GlassDateRangePicker`

**Status: Complete**
*   **Issue Number:** (N/A - Internal Audit)
*   **Component:** `GlassDateRangePicker`
*   **Version Fixed:** v1.0.14 (Documentation Update)
*   **Fix Notes:** Corrected documentation (`docs/components/glass-components.md`, `docs/installation/INSTALLATION.md`) to accurately reflect dependencies. Removed incorrect references to `@mui/x-date-pickers-pro` and `@mui/material`. Clarified that `GlassDateRangePicker` relies on Galileo's `GlassLocalizationProvider` and requires a date utility library (like `date-fns` or `dayjs`) configured via its adapter.

*   **Problem:** Using the `GlassDateRangePicker` component (after Fix #19) would likely lead to runtime or build errors due to a missing, undocumented peer dependency (`@mui/x-date-pickers-pro`).

*   **Root Cause:** Documentation incorrectly stated that `GlassDateRangePicker` required `@mui/x-date-pickers-pro` and `@mui/material` as peer dependencies.

*   **Solution:** The documentation (README, installation guides) has been updated to clearly state that `@mui/x-date-pickers-pro` is a required peer dependency for using `GlassDateRangePicker`. Associated dependencies (`@mui/material`, `@emotion/react`, `@emotion/styled`, and a date library like `dayjs`) are also noted.

*   **Impact:** Developers are now correctly informed about the actual dependencies for `GlassDateRangePicker`, avoiding installation of unnecessary MUI packages and ensuring correct setup with a date utility library and `GlassLocalizationProvider`.

        *   [x] Design and implement an API (`physics` prop?) for external configuration/override.
        *   [ ] Add tests for the new internal animation and the override mechanism.
        *   [x] Update documentation for `GlassTabs` regarding the new physics options.

*   **Enhancement 2: `DataChart` - Per-Element Physics Interactions**
    *   **Requirement:** Enable the application of external physics hooks (like `usePhysicsInteraction`) to individual data elements within the chart (e.g., bars, line points) for effects like hover interactions.
    *   **Tasks:**
        *   [ ] Locate `DataChart.tsx` and relevant element rendering logic (e.g., for bars, points).
        *   [ ] Design an API (`getElementPhysicsOptions={(dataPoint, index, type) => ({...})}` prop) to allow users to specify interaction config per element.
        *   [ ] Refactor element rendering/plugin logic to incorporate physics based on the user-provided config.
        *   [ ] Investigate and implement performance optimizations (critical due to potentially many elements).
        *   [ ] Add tests for per-element physics interactions.
        *   [ ] Update documentation for `DataChart` explaining the per-element interaction feature.

*   **Enhancement 3: `DataChart` - Modularity and Documentation Audit/Enhancement**
    *   **Requirement:** Audit the `DataChart` component for existing modular configuration options (axes, grids, etc.) and adaptive rendering capabilities. Implement missing essential modularity features and ensure all capabilities are clearly documented.
    *   **Tasks:**
        *   [ ] Audit `DataChart` source code for modularity/adaptivity features.
        *   [ ] Compare findings with current documentation.
        *   [ ] Identify undocumented features or missing essential configuration options.
        *   [ ] **(Decision Point)** If significant modularity is missing, decide if implementation fits within this task or needs a separate feature request.
        *   [x] Update/create documentation in `docs/components/data-chart.md` (or similar) to accurately reflect all available configuration options and modular patterns.

## 23. Fix: `engine.getBodyState()` Returns `null`

**Status: Partially Done (Core fix applied per PRD; Test added, verification pending)**
*   **Issue Number:** (Assign if applicable)
*   **Component/Hook:** `useGalileoPhysicsEngine`
*   **Version Target:** v1.0.15 (or next release)
*   **Problem:** Calls to `engine.getBodyState(bodyId)` consistently return `null` even after a body has been successfully created with `engine.addBody()` and its ID confirmed. This prevents tracking individual body states.
*   **Root Cause:** Unknown, likely an issue with internal state management, ID lookup, or synchronization within the `GalileoPhysicsSystem`.
*   **Impact:** Critical blocker for using the low-level physics engine API for custom simulations or rendering.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   [x] Debug `GalileoPhysicsSystem` state retrieval logic for `getBodyState`.
    *   [x] Analyze internal body map/store and ID handling.
    *   [x] Fix the root cause ensuring correct state object is returned.
    *   [ ] Add specific unit tests for `addBody` followed immediately and later by `getBodyState`.

*   **Issue Number:** (Assign if applicable)
*   **Component/Hook:** `useGalileoPhysicsEngine`
*   **Version Target:** v1.0.15 (or next release)
*   **Problem:** Collision detection configured via `useGalileoPhysicsEngine` (e.g., setting `collisionEvents: true` or using collision-related body options) does not appear to trigger collision events (`onCollisionStart`, etc.) or produce expected physical collision responses between bodies.
*   **Root Cause:** Unknown, potentially an issue in the collision detection algorithm (broadphase/narrowphase), event emission, or collision response logic within `GalileoPhysicsSystem`.
*   **Impact:** Blocks any features or demos relying on physics-based collisions.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   [ ] Review and debug the collision detection pipeline in `GalileoPhysicsSystem`.
    *   [ ] Verify broadphase and narrowphase collision checks.
    *   [x] Ensure collision event data is generated and emitted correctly.
    *   [x] Verify collision response forces/impulses are applied.
    *   [ ] Add comprehensive unit/integration tests for various collision scenarios (static/dynamic bodies, different shapes).
