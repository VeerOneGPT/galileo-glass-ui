# This script runs all automated fixing tools in sequence to address common issues
# in the codebase. It's useful for a quick cleanup before committing changes.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/auto-fix-all.sh
#
# What it does:
# 1. Runs the verification script to identify issues
# 2. Fixes unused variables by prefixing them with underscores
# 3. Fixes React Hook dependencies in useEffect, useMemo, and useCallback hooks
# 4. Runs verification again to check if issues were resolved
