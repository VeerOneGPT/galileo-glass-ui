# Directional Magnetic Fields and Force Modifiers Implementation

## Task Summary

I have successfully implemented directional magnetic fields and force modifiers for the Galileo Glass UI animation system. This feature enhances the magnetic effect system by providing more sophisticated and customizable interaction behaviors.

## Implementation Details

### Core Components

1. **Directional Field Configuration**
   - Created a comprehensive type system for defining directional fields
   - Implemented various field types (unidirectional, bidirectional, radial, tangential, vortex, flow)
   - Added configurable behaviors for different interaction styles

2. **Vector Field System**
   - Implemented a flexible flow field system with multiple interpolation methods
   - Created vector math utilities for field calculations
   - Built support for custom field shapes and behaviors

3. **Force Modifiers**
   - Implemented a powerful modifier system to transform forces
   - Created modifiers for damping, amplification, thresholding, capping, inverting, etc.
   - Added support for combining multiple modifiers for complex effects

4. **Integration with Existing System**
   - Extended `useMagneticEffect` hook to support directional fields
   - Enhanced the `MagneticEffectOptions` interface to include directional field configuration
   - Maintained backward compatibility with existing code

5. **Testing and Examples**
   - Created unit tests for all directional field functionality
   - Implemented a comprehensive example component showcasing different field types
   - Added test for the integration with the existing magnetic effect system

## Functionality Added

The new directional magnetic fields system enables the following capabilities:

1. **More Sophisticated Magnetic Effects**
   - Elements can now respond to the cursor with complex, directional behaviors
   - Force fields can have varying strengths and directions across their area
   - Animations can simulate physical phenomena like vortices and flow fields

2. **Guided User Interactions**
   - UI elements can guide users along specific paths or toward specific targets
   - Magnetic effects can create intuitive directional cues
   - Interactive elements can respond contextually to user position

3. **Enhanced Control and Customization**
   - Developers can define precise magnetic behaviors for different UI elements
   - Force modifiers allow fine-tuning of magnetic effects
   - Complex interaction patterns can be created by combining field types and modifiers

## Next Steps

This implementation lays the groundwork for the next features in the animation enhancement plan:

1. **Multi-element magnetic systems** - Building on the directional fields to create interrelated systems
2. **Mouse/pointer following with physics-based easing** - Enhancing the directional systems with more natural movement
3. **Magnetic snap points and alignment guides** - Leveraging directional fields for precise element positioning
